# Overview

MensemBot is a unified multi-platform bot supporting both Telegram and Discord, built with Python using aiogram and discord.py frameworks. The bot serves as a comprehensive tool for community management and gaming statistics, providing features like moderation, rules management, banned word filtering, user rank information, admin controls, and Arizona RP player statistics lookup. It's designed to help maintain order and provide information in gaming community chats, specifically for "Mensem Family" related to SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer) and Arizona RP servers.

- **Community Management**: Rules, ranks, admin controls, banned words filtering
- **Arizona RP Integration**: Player statistics lookup via Deps API
- **24/7 Operation**: Continuous running with Flask keep-alive server
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns across multiple specialized files

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Bot Framework
- **Core Frameworks**: 
  - aiogram (asynchronous Telegram Bot API framework)
  - discord.py (Discord API framework)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Unified event-driven command handling with custom filters
- **Multi-Platform Design**: Single codebase supporting both platforms simultaneously
- **Deployment**: Designed for cloud hosting with Flask keep-alive functionality

## Data Management
- **Storage**: JSON file-based data persistence
- **Data Structure**: Separate JSON files for different data types (rules, admins, banned words, info, ranks)
- **Location**: All data stored in `/data` directory
- **Manager Pattern**: Centralized DataManager class handles all file operations

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-Based Access**: Three-tier permission system (Creator > Admin > User)
- **Custom Filters**: IsAdmin and IsCreator filters for command access control
- **Admin Management**: Dynamic admin list stored in JSON file
- **Creator Privileges**: Hardcoded creator ID with highest permissions

## Command Structure
- **Public Commands**: /start, /help, /rules, /rank, /info, /staff, /id, /shop
- **Arizona RP Commands**: /stats <nickname> <server_id>, /servers
- **Admin Commands**: /setrules, /setinfo, /setrank, /addword, /unword, /words, /addadmin, /unadmin
- **Creator Commands**: /botstats (bot statistics access)
- **Platform Differences**: Discord uses ! prefix (!stats, !help), Telegram uses /
- **Private vs Group**: Some commands restricted to private messages

## Message Processing
- **Content Filtering**: Banned words system with automatic detection
- **Template System**: Predefined message templates in config
- **Markdown Support**: HTML parsing mode for formatted messages
- **Inline Keyboards**: Dynamic button generation for user interactions

## Application Logic
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns across multiple files
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and exception management
- **Reconnection Logic**: Built-in bot reconnection with retry attempts
- **Threading**: Separate thread for keep-alive web server
